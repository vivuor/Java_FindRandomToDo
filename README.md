# Website to find random things to do in Helsinki
Java project for school. You can add things to do, edit them, delete them, list them and find one thing to do by random. They are added to my MariaDB that is provided by my school. 

I'm planning to continue this project and make this an actual website. A everyday user can only find random things to do but admin can add, edit and delete things from database. I would also like to add Google map to show the exact location of the activity.

I used simple bootstrap styling with a little twists for better UX.
